# ETL_MiniProject_Group5
In this ETL Mini Project, we will demonstrate practicing building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data will be uploaded into a Postgres database.
